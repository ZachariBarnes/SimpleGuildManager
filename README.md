# SimpleGuildManager
This project is based on some work survfate did here:
https://github.com/survfate/poesimpleguild
I have heavily modified the program in order to allow it to funcation as a general guild manager
This program allows Game/Guild Masters to manage their members and keep track of contribution, last contribution date, how long someone has been a guild member and more.
Currently the program saves and reads from an .Xlsx file. Originally I had intended to make this program readand write  to/from google docs but I have lost interest in the project
Feel free to use this tool to manage your guilds or modify the tool in anyway you see fit.
Please let me know if you have questions.
