# SimpleGuildManager
This project is based on some work survfate did here: <br>
https://github.com/survfate/poesimpleguild<br>
I have heavily modified the program in order to allow it to funcation as a general guild manager
This program allows Game/Guild Masters to manage their members and keep track of contribution, last contribution date, how long someone has been a guild member and more.<br><br><br><br>
Currently the program saves and reads from an .Xlsx file. Originally I had intended to make this program readand write  to/from google docs but I have lost interest in the project<br><br><br>
Feel free to use this tool to manage your guilds or modify the tool in anyway you see fit.<br><br>
Please let me know if you have questions, I can be reached via email at ZachariBarnes@yahoo.com<br>
